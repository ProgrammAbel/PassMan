# PassMan
A different kind of password manager.

PassMan is a little project I'm making that is different to probably any password manager you've seen.

Most password managers store the passwords somewhere, either locally or on a secure server far away, and you can only get access to them if you have the master password.

PassMan is different - it doesn't store the password anywhere! No cloud, no cookie, no disk, nothing! Just type in the website and your Master Password and you have your password.

## Installation
To install PassMan, clone this repository and with the repo as your current directory, run
```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
Currently you can only import this as a module when not in the repo directory. I'm making a bash entry for this, and I'll upload this once I'm done.
