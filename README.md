# Passman
A different kind of password manager.

PassMan is a little project I'm making that is different to probably any password manager you've seen.

Many password managers store the passwords somewhere, either locally or on a secure server far away, and you can only get access to them if you have the master password.

PassMan is different - it doesn't store the password anywhere! No cloud, no cookie, no disk, nothing! Just type in the website and your Master Password and you have your password.

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites if you install it from the Releases section, which I recommend.

If you're building this application, all dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), which can be installed with Pip.

## Installation
The recommended way to install is by running the installer from the Releases section.

If you instead want to build it yourself, clone this repository and run
```
briefcase create
briefcase build
```

## Usage
If you have built the application, run
```
briefcase run
```
inside the directory.
