# Passman
A different kind of password manager.

PassMan is a little project I'm making that is different to probably any password manager you've seen.

Many password managers store the passwords somewhere, either locally or on a secure server far away, and you can only get access to them if you have the master password.

PassMan is different - it doesn't store the password anywhere! No cloud, no cookie, no disk, nothing! Just type in the website and your Master Password and you have your password.

## Installation
The recommended way to install is by running the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/ProgrammAbel/PassMan/releases) section.

## Usage
* **Windows** - Open PassMan from the Start menu.
* **macOS** - Open PassMan using Spotlight or the launcher.
* **Linux** - Open the .AppImage file.
